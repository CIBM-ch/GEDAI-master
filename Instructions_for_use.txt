Basic instructions for using the GEDAI plugin for EEGLAB


* Step 1: After importing the EEG data, go to **Edit -> Channel locations**, to import channel labels/locations (unless already done so).
Make sure a) EEG channel labels (e.g. "Fp1", "Fz", etc without any trailing characters) or b) EEG channel locations (e.g. XYZ coordinates) are present in the EEG.chanlocs structure. 

* Step 2:  Launch the GEDAI plugin. We recommend high-passing the data when GEDAI denoising (e.g. low-cut frequency = 0.5 Hz)

* Step 3: For the leadfield matrix type, depending on Step 1 above, a) use option "precomputed", for b) use option "interpolated".

May the EEG force be with you 👍
